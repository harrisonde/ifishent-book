# Preface
A running track record about my software development expereience during the fall semester. In the pages of this book, information related to project, proposal, deliverables, slides for presentation, video clips regarding progress made/ deliverables. 

I hope to capture the how the project changes over the next six months.

More specifically, the purpose of this book is to track weekly progress, answer questions like:

- What did you do?
- Why did you do it?
- What is your plan for the next week? 
- Who did you speak with or get feedback from? How has it changed your thinking or approach to your project?
- What's working well? What's not working so well?
Did you decide to change direction? If so, why? How does this impact final deliverables?
- What do you need feedback on now?

Thank you for taking time to read/ comment on my ramblings.
