Thinking through the information the application's persona(s) will find insightful is a task, to say the least. Michael (the primary persona) is a white American male in his early 40’s living in California – since California has the highest number of developer jobs (United States Department of Labor, 2012). He recently resigned from the Angular team at Google, leaving behind a $124,000.00 paycheck to join a new startup (zSpace) in Palo Alto, California. Jennifer, the secondary persona is a white American female in her mid 40’s living in California – California has the highest number of technical writer jobs (United States Department of Labor, 2014). She has worked a zSpace in Palo Alto, California for the past year.
I need to identify the specific information each persona might want to know. A possible starting point is gender - as gender influences what "things" are seen as insightful. The male persona enjoys an application's "features" and the "cool" things it may do. Flip that on its head, females strip the application down to its core and want to know how it works to their advantage. The email needs to account for both, providing helpful information and "cool" features.
