# Progress

The past few months were a whirlwind of events beginning with selling my home, purchasing another home, and starting a full renovation of said home. When I was not dealing with the business end of a hammer, I dedicated a large portion of my time to research. Specifically, researching productivity and how to be more efficient in the workplace. As I've mentioned in the [Proposal](../docs/proposal.md), American business culture expects employees to work long hours: overworking is one way you get ahead. A possible solution to this problem is to minimize overworking by creating a fix time period to complete a specific task: enter ifishent.

The months of April and May were learning how to juggle a renovation, writing, research, and refinement of my proposal/application. I decided the primary goals of the application are assisting users to increase good productivity habits, decrease burnout through working intervals, and providing insight to user about their working habits. Furthermore, the application will benefits my users in several ways.
  * Provide a complete picture of tasks accomplished and hours worked
  * Merge the concept of a timer and to-do list into one piece of software
  * Create working intervals base upon the lasted productivity research

July was spent reviewing agile project management tools, hosting options, code deployment tools, and blog platforms. I’ve mentioned a few of theses in [standup notes](../stand-up/README.md). I will use GitBook to host the daily log of my development activities, Pivotal Tracker for project management, and Github as my code repository tool. I also confirmed the technologies/ tools needed to create the application: HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP will get the job done. Laravel and Ionic are two open-source projects I will implement since their community backing is very strong. 

In August, I started to develop a workflow to get my project off the ground. I setup Gitbook and added my development notes and integrated Github, Gitbook, and Pivotal Tracker. As an aside, I wanted to push code to Github and have a webhook update Gitbook/ Pivotal Tracker.

Currently, I’m working on setting up a local development environment and stubbing out code to get my API up and running with user authentication.
