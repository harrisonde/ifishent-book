One goal of the software is to help users work efficiently, specifically breaking work into 90 minute intervals. When applying both my user personas to this goal, the applicationâ€™s user experience emerges.
It's critical that creating or adding a task be very simple as possible since it could lead to increased friction. If the user has to spend a lot of time searching, users will not stick around to use the application. The goal is to help users be productive, not add additional friction to their day.
It is crucial that working states can be modified by way of a signifier, start or stop button. The user must be able to easily jump between working states (e.g., working or taking a break) when the application generates a push notification.
Signing into the application must be simple since users are overburdened with multiple login and password combinations. Users will have an option to login using their Google email account or a system defined username and password.
By having an understanding of the user experience needs, the application screens emerge. I expect to build no more than six screens (e.g., login, registration, dashboard, navigation, task, and dashboard) and a few additional components, such as navigation.
